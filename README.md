# my-nvim-playlist
Contains my personal nvim configuration.

## Using it in a github code space.
To use it in github code space, make sure to move the nvim folder into the default
nvim program config directory. For my linux github codespace, this directory is `~/.config`.
So copy over the `nvim` folder to the path `~/.config/nvim`.
